# This hash should generally contain any error that could be thrown
# by the WebService interface. If it's extremely unlikely that the
# error could be thrown (like some CodeErrors), it doesn't have to
# be listed here.
#
# "Transient" means "If you resubmit that request with different data,
# it may work."
#
# "Fatal" means, "There's something wrong with Bugzilla, probably
# something an administrator would have to fix."
#
# NOTE: Numbers must never be recycled. If you remove a number, leave a
# comment that it was retired. Also, if an error changes its name, you'll
# have to fix it here.
