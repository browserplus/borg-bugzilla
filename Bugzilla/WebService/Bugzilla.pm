=head1 NAME

Bugzilla::WebService::Bugzilla - Global functions for the webservice interface.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides functions that tell you about Bugzilla in general.

=head1 METHODS

See L<Bugzilla::WebService> for a description of how parameters are passed,
and what B<STABLE>, B<UNSTABLE>, and B<EXPERIMENTAL> mean.

=over

=item C<version>

B<STABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

Returns the current version of Bugzilla.

=item B<Params> (none)

=item B<Returns>

A hash with a single item, C<version>, that is the version as a
string.

=item B<Errors> (none)

=back

=item C<extensions>

B<EXPERIMENTAL>

=over

=item B<Description>

Gets information about the extensions that are currently installed and enabled
in this Bugzilla.

=item B<Params> (none)

=item B<Returns>

A hash with a single item, C<extensions>. This points to a hash. I<That> hash
contains the names of extensions as keys, and the values are a hash.
That hash contains a single key C<version>, which is the version of the
extension, or C<0> if the extension hasn't defined a version.

The return value looks something like this:

 extensions => {
     Example => {
         version => '3.6',
     },
     BmpConvert => {
         version => '1.0',
     },
 }

=item B<History>

=over

=item Added in Bugzilla B<3.2>.

=item As of Bugzilla B<3.6>, the names of extensions are canonical names
that the extensions define themselves. Before 3.6, the names of the
extensions depended on the directory they were in on the Bugzilla server.

=back

=back

=item C<timezone>

B<DEPRECATED> This method may be removed in a future version of Bugzilla.
Use L</time> instead.

=over

=item B<Description>

Returns the timezone that Bugzilla expects dates and times in.

=item B<Params> (none)

=item B<Returns>

A hash with a single item, C<timezone>, that is the timezone offset as a
string in (+/-)XXXX (RFC 2822) format.

=item B<History>

=over

=item As of Bugzilla B<3.6>, the timezone returned is always C<+0000>
(the UTC timezone).

=back

=back


=item C<time>

B<STABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

Gets information about what time the Bugzilla server thinks it is, and
what timezone it's running in.

=item B<Params> (none)

=item B<Returns>

A struct with the following items:

=over

=item C<db_time>

C<dateTime> The current time in UTC, according to the Bugzilla 
I<database server>.

Note that Bugzilla assumes that the database and the webserver are running
in the same time zone. However, if the web server and the database server
aren't synchronized for some reason, I<this> is the time that you should
rely on for doing searches and other input to the WebService.

=item C<web_time>

C<dateTime> This is the current time in UTC, according to Bugzilla's 
I<web server>.

This might be different by a second from C<db_time> since this comes from
a different source. If it's any more different than a second, then there is
likely some problem with this Bugzilla instance. In this case you should
rely on the C<db_time>, not the C<web_time>.

=item C<web_time_utc>

Identical to C<web_time>. (Exists only for backwards-compatibility with
versions of Bugzilla before 3.6.)

=item C<tz_name>

C<string> The literal string C<UTC>. (Exists only for backwards-compatibility
with versions of Bugzilla before 3.6.) 

=item C<tz_short_name>

C<string> The literal string C<UTC>. (Exists only for backwards-compatibility
with versions of Bugzilla before 3.6.)

=item C<tz_offset>

C<string> The literal string C<+0000>. (Exists only for backwards-compatibility
with versions of Bugzilla before 3.6.)

=back

=item B<History>

=over

=item Added in Bugzilla B<3.4>.

=item As of Bugzilla B<3.6>, this method returns all data as though the server
were in the UTC timezone, instead of returning information in the server's
local timezone.
