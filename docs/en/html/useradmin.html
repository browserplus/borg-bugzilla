>&#13;          The first screen is a search form to search for existing user
          accounts. You can run searches based either on the user ID, real
          name or login name (i.e. the email address, or just the first part
          of the email address if the "emailsuffix" parameter is set).
          The search can be conducted
          in different ways using the listbox to the right of the text entry
          box. You can match by case-insensitive substring (the default),
          regular expression, a <EM
>reverse</EM
> regular expression
          match (which finds every user name which does NOT match the regular
          expression), or the exact string if you know exactly who you are
          looking for. The search can be restricted to users who are in a
          specific group. By default, the restriction is turned off.
        </P
><P
>&#13;          The search returns a list of
          users matching your criteria. User properties can be edited by clicking
          the login name. The Account History of a user can be viewed by clicking
          the "View" link in the Account History column. The Account History
          displays changes that have been made to the user account, the time of
          the change and the user who made the change. For example, the Account
          History page will display details of when a user was added or removed
          from a group.

            This flag allows a user to create new products and components,

            with them. If a product or component has bugs associated with it,

            If you use Bugzilla's keyword functionality, enabling this

            the keywords for existing bugs containing the keyword the user

            This flag allows a user to do what you're doing right now: edit
            other users. This will allow those with the right to do so to
            remove administrator privileges from other users or grant them to
            themselves. Enable with care.</P

            This allows an administrator to specify the products 
            in which a user can see bugs. If you turn on the 
            <SPAN

            the Group Security Panel in the Parameters page, 
            then Bugzilla creates one group per product (at the time you create 
            the product), and this group has exactly the same name as the 
            product itself. Note that for products that already exist when
            the parameter is turned on, the corresponding group will not be
            created. The user must still have the <SPAN

          Note that this is most of the time not the best thing to do. If only

          If a warning is also displayed in a red box, then you should NOT try
          to delete the user account, else you will get referential integrity
          problems in your database, which can lead to unexpected behavior,
