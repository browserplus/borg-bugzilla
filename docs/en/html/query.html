>The Search page has controls for selecting different possible
    values for all of the fields in a bug, as described above. For some
    fields, multiple values can be selected. In those cases, Bugzilla
    returns bugs where the content of the field matches any one of the selected
    values. If none is selected, then the field can take any value.</P
><P
>&#13;      After a search is run, you can save it as a Saved Search, which
      will appear in the page footer. If you are in the group defined 
      by the "querysharegroup" parameter, you may share your queries 
      with other users, see <A

>&#13;        The boolean charts further restrict the set of results
        returned by a query. It is possible to search for bugs
        based on elaborate combinations of criteria.

        Using the "And," "Or," and "Add Another Boolean Chart" buttons,

>&#13;          Sometimes, a query needs to compare a user-related field
          (such as ReportedBy) with a role-specific user (such as the
          user running the query or the user to whom each bug is assigned).
          When the operator is either "equals" or "notequals", the value
          can be "%reporter%", "%assignee%", "%qacontact%", or "%user%".
          The user pronoun
          refers to the user who is executing the query or, in the case
          of whining reports, the user who will be the recipient
          of the report. The reporter, assignee, and qacontact
          pronouns refer to the corresponding fields in the bug.
        </P
><P
>&#13;          Boolean charts also let you type a group name in any user-related
          field if the operator is either "equals", "notequals" or "anyexact".
          This will let you query for any member belonging (or not) to the
          specified group. The group name must be entered following the
          "%group.foo%" syntax, where "foo" is the group name.
          So if you are looking for bugs reported by any user being in the
          "editbugs" group, then you can type "%group.editbugs%".

          did contain the string. Similarly, the use of negation also permits
          complex expressions to be built using terms OR'd together and then
          negated. Negation permits queries such as

        into Quicksearch would search for "foo" or "bar" in the
        summary and status whiteboard of a bug; adding

        search only in that product.

        you can specify several alternate formats. Besides the types described

NAME="individual-buglists"
>5.5.5. Adding/removing tags to/from bugs</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;        You can add and remove tags from individual bugs, which let you find and
        manage them more easily. Creating a new tag automatically generates a saved
        search - whose name is the name of the tag - which lists bugs with this tag.
        This saved search will be displayed in the footer of pages by default, as
        all other saved searches. The main difference between tags and normal saved
        searches is that saved searches, as described in the previous section, are
        stored in the form of a list of matching criteria, while the saved search
        generated by tags is a list of bug numbers. Consequently, you can easily
        edit this list by either adding or removing tags from bugs. To enable this
        feature, you have to turn on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Enable tags for bugs"</SPAN
> user
        preference, see <A
HREF="userpreferences.html"
>Section 5.10</A
>. This feature is disabled
        by default.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        This feature is useful when you want to keep track of several bugs, but
        for different reasons. Instead of adding yourself to the CC list of all
        these bugs and mixing all these reasons, you can now store these bugs in
        separate lists, e.g. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Keep in mind"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Interesting bugs"</SPAN
>,
        or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Triage"</SPAN
>. One big advantage of this way to manage bugs
        is that you can easily add or remove bugs one by one, which is not
        possible to do with saved searches without having to edit the search
        criteria again.
