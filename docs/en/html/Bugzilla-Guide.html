        configure, and therefore many people replace Sendmail with Postfix or

        ensure that the mail is delivered properly. They are implemented

>&#13;                    mod_perl support in Bugzilla can take up a HUGE amount of RAM. You could be
                    looking at 30MB per httpd child, easily. Basically, you just need a lot of RAM.
                    The more RAM you can get, the better. mod_perl is basically trading RAM for
                    speed. At least 2GB total system RAM is recommended for running Bugzilla under
                    mod_perl.

					<EM
>restart</EM

      possible by using the PROJECT environment variable. When accessed,
      Bugzilla checks for the existence of this variable, and if present, uses
      its value to check for an alternative configuration file named
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>localconfig.&#60;PROJECT&#62;</TT

          </P
><P
>&#13;          The existing authentication
          scheme for Bugzilla uses email addresses as the primary user ID, and a
          password to authenticate that user. All places within Bugzilla that
          require a user ID (e.g assigning a bug) use the email
          address. The LDAP authentication builds on top of this scheme, rather
          than replacing it. The initial log-in is done with a username and
          password for the LDAP directory. Bugzilla tries to bind to LDAP using
          those credentials and, if successful, tries to map this account to a
          Bugzilla account. If an LDAP mail attribute is defined, the value of this
          attribute is used, otherwise the "emailsuffix" parameter is appended to LDAP
          username to form a full email address. If an account for this address
          already exists in the Bugzilla installation, it will log in to that account.
          If no account for that email address exists, one is created at the time
          of login. (In this case, Bugzilla will attempt to use the "displayName"
          or "cn" attribute to determine the user's full name.) After
          authentication, all other user-related tasks are still handled by email
          address, not LDAP username. For example, bugs are still assigned by
          email address and users are still queried by email address.

>&#13;                When Bugzilla is using Sendmail older than 8.12, turning this option
                off will improve performance by not waiting for Sendmail to actually
                send mail.  If Sendmail 8.12 or later is being used, there is 
                nothing to gain by turning this off.  If another MTA is being used, 
                such as Postfix, then this option *must* be turned on (even if you 
                are using the fake sendmail executable that Postfix provides).

          specified group. The group name must be entered following the
          "%group.foo%" syntax, where "foo" is the group name.
          So if you are looking for bugs reported by any user being in the
          "editbugs" group, then you can type "%group.editbugs%".

></H3
><P
>&#13;        You can add and remove tags from individual bugs, which let you find and
        manage them more easily. Creating a new tag automatically generates a saved
        search - whose name is the name of the tag - which lists bugs with this tag.
        This saved search will be displayed in the footer of pages by default, as
        all other saved searches. The main difference between tags and normal saved
        searches is that saved searches, as described in the previous section, are
        stored in the form of a list of matching criteria, while the saved search
        generated by tags is a list of bug numbers. Consequently, you can easily
        edit this list by either adding or removing tags from bugs. To enable this
        feature, you have to turn on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Enable tags for bugs"</SPAN
> user
        preference, see <A
HREF="#userpreferences"
>Section 5.10</A
>. This feature is disabled
        by default.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        This feature is useful when you want to keep track of several bugs, but
        for different reasons. Instead of adding yourself to the CC list of all
        these bugs and mixing all these reasons, you can now store these bugs in
        separate lists, e.g. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Keep in mind"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Interesting bugs"</SPAN
>,
        or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Triage"</SPAN
>. One big advantage of this way to manage bugs
        is that you can easily add or remove bugs one by one, which is not
        possible to do with saved searches without having to edit the search
        criteria again.

      However, Bugzilla will automatically make hyperlinks out of certain

      To take an example: a user can set up their account to filter out messages
      where someone just adds themselves to the CC field of a bug
      (which happens a lot.) If you come along, add yourself to the CC field,

>As well as the standard buglist, Bugzilla has two more ways of
    viewing sets of bugs. These are the reports (which give different
    views of the current state of the database) and charts (which plot
    the changes in particular sets of bugs over time.)</P

>&#13;        A report is a view of the current state of the bug database.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        You can run either an HTML-table-based report, or a graphical
        line/pie/bar-chart-based one. The two have different pages to
        define them, but are close cousins - once you've defined and
        viewed a report, you can switch between any of the different
        views of the data at will.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Both report types are based on the idea of defining a set of bugs
        using the standard search interface, and then choosing some
        aspect of that set to plot on the horizontal and/or vertical axes.
        You can also get a form of 3-dimensional report by choosing to have
        multiple images or tables.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        So, for example, you could use the search form to choose "all
        bugs in the WorldControl product", and then plot their severity
        against their component to see which component had had the largest
        number of bad bugs reported against it. 
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Once you've defined your parameters and hit "Generate Report",
        you can switch between HTML, CSV, Bar, Line and Pie. (Note: Pie
        is only available if you didn't define a vertical axis, as pie
        charts don't have one.) The other controls are fairly self-explanatory;
        you can change the size of the image if you find text is overwriting
        other text, or the bars are too thin to see.

>&#13;        Bugzilla currently has two charting systems - Old Charts and New 
        Charts. Old Charts have been part of Bugzilla for a long time; they
        chart each status and resolution for each product, and that's all.
        They are deprecated, and going away soon - we won't say any more 
        about them.
        New Charts are the future - they allow you to chart anything you
        can define as a search.

>&#13;        An individual line on a chart is called a data set.
        All data sets are organised into categories and subcategories. The 
        data sets that Bugzilla defines automatically use the Product name 
        as a Category and Component names as Subcategories, but there is no 
        need for you to follow that naming scheme with your own charts if 
        you don't want to.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Data sets may be public or private. Everyone sees public data sets in
        the list, but only their creator sees private data sets. Only 
        administrators can make data sets public.
        No two data sets, even two private ones, can have the same set of 
        category, subcategory and name. So if you are creating private data 
        sets, one idea is to have the Category be your username.

          To Plot, you can define the label that data set will have in the
          chart's legend, and also ask Bugzilla to Sum a number of data sets 
          (e.g. you could Sum data sets representing RESOLVED, VERIFIED and 
          CLOSED in a particular product to get a data set representing all 
          the resolved bugs in that product.)

          automatically appears at the bottom of the list. If you don't want
          this, simply remove it as you would remove any other line.
        </P

>&#13;          You may also choose to plot only over a certain date range, and
          to cumulate the results - that is, to plot each one using the

          the data sets. It's easier to try than to explain :-)
        </P

      to indicate that the bugs/attachments are in a certain state.
      Each installation can define its own set of flags that can be set
      on bugs or attachments.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If your installation has defined a flag, you can set or unset that flag,
      and if your administrator has enabled requesting of flags, you can submit
      a request for another user to set the flag.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      To set a flag, select either "+" or "-" from the drop-down menu next to
      the name of the flag in the "Flags" list.  The meaning of these values are
      flag-specific and thus cannot be described in this documentation,
      but by way of example, setting a flag named "review" to "+" may indicate
      that the bug/attachment has passed review, while setting it to "-"
      may indicate that the bug/attachment has failed review.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      To unset a flag, click its drop-down menu and select the blank value.
      Note that marking an attachment as obsolete automatically cancels all
      pending requests for the attachment.
    </P

>&#13;      If your administrator has enabled requests for a flag, request a flag
      by selecting "?" from the drop-down menu and then entering the username
      of the user you want to set the flag in the text field next to the menu.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A set flag appears in bug reports and on "edit attachment" pages with the
      abbreviated username of the user who set the flag prepended to the
      flag name. For example, if Jack sets a "review" flag to "+", it appears
      as Jack: review [ + ]

>&#13;      A requested flag appears with the user who requested the flag prepended
      to the flag name and the user who has been requested to set the flag

      asks Jill for review, it appears as Jack: review [ ? ] (Jill).

>&#13;      One of the best ways to customize Bugzilla is by writing a Bugzilla
      Extension. Bugzilla Extensions let you modify both the code and
      UI of Bugzilla in a way that can be distributed to other Bugzilla
      users and ported forward to future versions of Bugzilla with minimal
      effort.

        modifications, and the method you plan to use to upgrade Bugzilla.
      </P

>&#13;        The first method of making customizations is to directly edit the
        templates found in <TT

        This is probably the best way to go about it if you are going to
        be upgrading Bugzilla through CVS, because if you then execute
        a <B

        be merged automagically with the updated versions.

        you are using the CVS method of upgrading and are going to make major
        changes, because it is guaranteed that the contents of this directory
        will not be touched during an upgrade, and you can then decide whether
        to continue using your own templates, or make the effort to merge your

>&#13;        The syntax of the Template Toolkit language is beyond the scope of

>&#13;        One thing you should take particular care about is the need
        to properly HTML filter data that has been passed into the template.
        This means that if the data can possibly contain special HTML characters
        such as &#60;, and the data was not intended to be HTML, they need to be
        converted to entity form, i.e. &#38;lt;.  You use the 'html' filter in the
        Template Toolkit to do this.  If you forget, you may open up
        your installation to cross-site scripting attacks.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Also note that Bugzilla adds a few filters of its own, that are not
        in standard Template Toolkit.  In particular, the 'url_quote' filter
        can convert characters that are illegal or have special meaning in URLs,
        such as &#38;, to the encoded form, i.e. %26.  This actually encodes most
        characters (but not the common ones such as letters and numbers and so
        on), including the HTML-special characters, so there's never a need to
        HTML filter afterwards.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Editing templates is a good way of doing a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"poor man's custom
        fields"</SPAN
>.
        For example, if you don't use the Status Whiteboard, but want to have
        a free-form text entry box for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Build Identifier"</SPAN
>,
        then you can just
        edit the templates to change the field labels. It's still be called
        status_whiteboard internally, but your users don't need to know that.

        This template controls the appearance of the bug lists created

        You may not wish to go to the effort of creating custom fields in
        Bugzilla, yet you want to make sure that each bug report contains
        a number of pieces of important information for which there is not
        a special field. The bug entry system has been designed in an
        extensible fashion to enable you to add arbitrary HTML widgets,
        such as drop-down lists or textboxes, to the bug entry page
        and have their values appear formatted in the initial comment.
        A hidden field that indicates the format should be added inside
        the form in order to make the template functional. Its value should
        be the suffix of the template filename. For example, if the file
        is called <TT

>&#13;      Companies often have rules about which employees, or classes of employees,
      are allowed to change certain things in the bug system. For example, 
      only the bug's designated QA Contact may be allowed to VERIFY the bug.
      Bugzilla has been
      designed to make it easy for you to write your own custom rules to define
      who is allowed to make what sorts of value transition.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     By default, assignees, QA owners and users
     with <EM
>editbugs</EM
> privileges can edit all fields of bugs, 
     except group restrictions (unless they are members of the groups they 
     are trying to change). Bug reporters also have the ability to edit some 
     fields, but in a more restrictive manner. Other users, without 
     <EM
>editbugs</EM
> privileges, can not edit 
     bugs, except to comment and add themselves to the CC list.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      For maximum flexibility, customizing this means editing Bugzilla's Perl 
      code. This gives the administrator complete control over exactly who is
      allowed to do what. The relevant method is called
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>check_can_change_field()</TT
>,
      and is found in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Bug.pm</TT
> in your
      Bugzilla/ directory. If you open that file and search for
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"sub check_can_change_field"</SPAN
>, you'll find it.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      This function has been carefully commented to allow you to see exactly
      how it works, and give you an idea of how to make changes to it.
      Certain marked sections should not be changed - these are
      the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"plumbing"</SPAN
> which makes the rest of the function work.
      In between those sections, you'll find snippets of code like:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"

    if ($ownerid eq $whoid) {
        return 1;
    }</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      It's fairly obvious what this piece of code does.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      So, how does one go about changing this function? Well, simple changes
      can be made just by removing pieces - for example, if you wanted to 
      prevent any user adding a comment to a bug, just remove the lines marked
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Allow anyone to change comments."</SPAN
> If you don't want the
      Reporter to have any special rights on bugs they have filed, just
      remove the entire section that deals with the Reporter.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      More complex customizations are not much harder. Basically, you add
      a check in the right place in the function, i.e. after all the variables
      you are using have been set up. So, don't look at $ownerid before 
      $ownerid has been obtained from the database. You can either add a
      positive check, which returns 1 (allow) if certain conditions are true,
      or a negative check, which returns 0 (deny.) E.g.:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE

        } 
        else {
            return 0;
        }
    }</PRE
></FONT
></TD

      This says that only users in the group "quality_assurance" can change
      the QA Contact field of a bug.
    </P

      This says that if the user is trying to change the priority field,
      and their email address is @example.com, they can only do so if the

>&#13;      To accomplish this task, <TT

      the same mechanism as the <TT

>sanitycheck.cgi</TT
> script;
      it scans through the entire database looking for bugs with changes that
      were made more than 30 minutes ago, but where there is no record of
      anyone related to that bug having been sent mail. Having compiled a list,
      it then uses the standard rules to determine who gets mail, and sends it
      out.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      As the script runs, it indicates the bug for which it is currently
      sending mail; when it has finished, it gives a numerical count of how
      many mails were sent and how many people were excluded. (Individual
      user names are not recorded or displayed.) If the script produces
      no output, that means no unsent mail was detected.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      <EM
>Usage</EM
>: move the sendunsentbugmail.pl script
      up into the main directory, ensure it has execute permission, and run it
      from the command line (or from a cron job) with no parameters.

></H2
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
    the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such
    manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed
    as "you".</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
    of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
    with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this License.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
    public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
    by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
    "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or

    as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full
    title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may
    add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document

>I've been asked to explain this ... way back when, when
          Netscape released version 4.0 of its browser, we had a release
          party.  Naturally, there had been a big push to try and fix every
          known bug before the release. Naturally, that hadn't actually
          happened.  (This is not unique to Netscape or to 4.0; the same thing
          has happened with every software project I've ever seen.)  Anyway,
          at the release party, T-shirts were handed out that said something
          like "Netscape 4.0: Zarro Boogs". Just like the software, the
          T-shirt had no known bugs.  Uh-huh.
