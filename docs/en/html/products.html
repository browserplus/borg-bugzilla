>&#13;        Group Access Controls are an important aspect of using groups for

        Bugzilla installation is displayed. The system groups that are created
        when Bugzilla is installed are not applicable to Group Access Controls.
        Below is description of what each of these fields means.
        </P
><P
>&#13;        Groups may be applicable (e.g bugs in this product can be associated
        with this group) , default (e.g. bugs in this product are in this group
        by default), and mandatory (e.g. bugs in this product must be associated
        with this group) for each product. Groups can also control access 
        to bugs for a given product, or be used to make bugs for a product 
        totally read-only unless the group restrictions are met. The best way to
        understand these relationships is by example. See 
        <A
