>&#13;    Groups allow for separating bugs into logical divisions.
    Groups are typically used to
    to isolate bugs that should only be seen by certain people. For
    example, a company might create a different group for each one of its customers
    or partners. Group permissions could be set so that each partner or customer would
    only have access to their own bugs. Or, groups might be used to create
    variable access controls for different departments within an organization.
    Another common use of groups is to associate groups with products,
    creating isolation and access control on a per-product basis.
    </P
><P
>&#13;    Groups and group behaviors are controlled in several places:
    </P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;             The group configuration page. To view or edit existing groups, or to
             create new groups, access the "Groups" link from the "Administration"
             page. This section of the manual deals primarily with the aspect of
             group controls accessed on this page.  
           </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;            Global configuration parameters. Bugzilla has several parameters 
            that control the overall default group behavior and restriction
            levels. For more information on the parameters that control 
            group behavior globally, see <A
HREF="parameters.html#param-group-security"
>Section 3.1.9</A

          </P
></LI

><P
>&#13;            Product association with groups. Most of the functionality of groups
            and group security is controlled at the product level. Some aspects
            of group access controls for products are discussed in this section,
            but for more detail see <A
HREF="products.html#product-group-controls"
>Section 3.4.4</A

HREF="groups.html#users-and-groups"

            details on how users are assigned group access.
          </P
></LI

><P
>&#13;      Group permissions are such that if a bug belongs to a group, only members
      of that group can see the bug. If a bug is in more than one group, only
      members of <EM
>all</EM
> the groups that the bug is in can see
      the bug. For information on granting read-only access to certain people and
      full edit access to others, see <A

            this group should be used for bugs (in all likelihood this should be
            selected). Optionally, choose a regular expression that will
            automatically add any matching users to the group, and choose an
            icon that will help identify user comments for the group. The regular
            expression can be useful, for example, to automatically put all users
            from the same company into one group (if the group is for a specific
            customer or partner).

       all users from the group who match the regular expression entered. The
       "Group Permissions" section requires further explanation.

>&#13;       The "Group Permissions" section on the "Edit Groups" page contains four sets
       of permissions that control the relationship of this group to other
       groups. If the 'usevisibilitygroups' parameter is in use (see
       <A
HREF="parameters.html"
>Section 3.1</A
>) two additional sets of permissions are displayed. 
       Each set consists of two select boxes. On the left, a select box
       with a list of all existing groups. On the right, a select box listing
       all groups currently selected for this permission setting (this box will
       be empty for new groups). The way these controls allow groups to relate
       to one another is called <EM
>inheritance</EM

       Each of the six permissions is described below.
