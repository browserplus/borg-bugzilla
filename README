What is Bugzilla?
=================
Bugzilla is a free bug-tracking system that is developed by an active
community of volunteers in the Mozilla community. You can install and
use it without having to pay any license fee.

Minimum requirements
====================
It can be installed on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and other Unix flavors.
Bugzilla is written in Perl, meaning that Perl must be installed on your system.
You will also need a web server as well as a DB server (see below).

Installation & Upgrading
========================
The documentation to install, upgrade, configure and use Bugzilla can be found
in different formats:
* docs/en/html/Bugzilla-Guide.html (HTML version)
* docs/en/txt/Bugzilla-Guide.txt (text version)
* docs/en/pdf/Bugzilla-Guide.pdf (PDF version)

If the documentation is missing, you can get it online by visiting
http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/ from where you can select the documentation
corresponding to the Bugzilla version you are installing.

Bugzilla Quick Start Guide
==========================
(or, how to get Bugzilla up and running in 10 steps)
Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

This express installation guide is for "normal" Bugzilla installations,
which means a Linux or Unix system on which Apache, Perl, MySQL or PostgreSQL
and a Sendmail compatible MTA are available. For other configurations, please
see the "Installing Bugzilla" section of the Bugzilla Guide in the docs/ directory.

1. Decide from which URL and directory under your webserver root you
   will be serving the Bugzilla webpages.

2. Unpack the distribution into the chosen directory (there is no copying or
   installation involved).

3. Run ./checksetup.pl, look for unsolved requirements, and install them.
   You can run checksetup as many times as necessary to check if
   everything required has been installed.

   These will usually include assorted Perl modules, MySQL or PostgreSQL,
   and a MTA.

   After a successful dependency check, checksetup should complain that
   localconfig needs to be edited.

4. Edit the localconfig file, in particular the $webservergroup and
   $db_* variables. In particular, $db_name and $db_user will define
   your database setup in step 5.

5. Create a user permission for the name supplied as $db_user with
   read/write access to the database whose name is given by $db_name.

   If you are not familiar with MySQL permissions, it's a good idea to
   use the mysql_setpermission script that is installed with the MySQL
   distribution, and be sure to read Bugzilla Security - MySQL section
   in the Bugzilla Guide or PostgreSQL documentation.

6. Run checksetup.pl once more; if all goes well, it should set up the
   Bugzilla database for you. If not, return to step 5.

   checksetup.pl should ask you, this time, for the administrator's
   email address and password. These will be used for the initial
   Bugzilla administrator account.

7. Configure Apache (or install and configure, if you don't have it up
   yet) to point to the Bugzilla directory. You can choose between
   mod_cgi and mod_perl. The Bugzilla documentation has detailed information
   for both modes.

8. Visit the URL you chose for Bugzilla. Your browser should display the
   default Bugzilla home page. You should then log in as the
   administrator by following the "Log in" link and supplying the
   account information you provided in step 6.

9. Visit the "Parameters" page, as suggested by the page displayed to you.
   Set up the relevant parameters for your local setup.

10. That's it. If anything unexpected comes up:

    - read the error message carefully,
    - backtrack through the steps above,
    - check the official installation guide.

Support and installation questions should be directed to the
support-bugzilla@lists.mozilla.org mailing list.
